desktop app

this is a desktop app, or we can say swing app because I used swing, what you can create, update or delete with own your notes at databases. 

also, you can see others notes but ofcourse you can't delete them :)  I added some features like searching on database records and listing them.  

technologies I'm used are Java, hibernate, maven, mysql and lastly swing (for interface).
