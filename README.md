desktop app

this is a desktop app, or we can say swing app because I used swing, what you can create, update or delete with own your notes at databases. 

also, you can see others notes but ofcourse you can't delete them :)  I added some features like searching on database records and listing them.  

technologies I'm used are Java, hibernate, maven, mysql and lastly swing (for interface).

if you have mysql database on your machine you can download this project, after some database configuration for yours, you can run directly from desktop by runnable jar file. when you double click you're gonna see app window.

however I don't know what it is usable for you, because this is like local project or it just can be usable only to spesific a goal. but you can develop this project for any stuffs.
